// Migration away from the original SnapHak.
//
// A DOOM folder that ran the original SnapHak (the closed-source tool this project supersedes) carries
// its overlay: proxy DLLs at the game root (dinput8.dll -- a bundled console-unlock mod -- plus
// XINPUT1_3.dll and two helper DLLs), a Qt UI runtime inside snaphak\, a Qt platform plugin, and two
// text files. None of these are vanilla game files, and Snapmap+ replaces all of them. Install
// (and therefore update) removes them first: left in place they'd either be backed up as if they were
// genuine game files (XINPUT1_3.dll -- uninstall would later "restore" a non-vanilla DLL) or linger
// as dead files nothing loads (the helper DLLs, the Qt runtime).
//
// Detection is deliberately conservative: it keys on files ONLY the original SnapHak ships. A lone
// dinput8.dll (which could be an unrelated mod) or a lone changelog.txt never triggers migration --
// those are removed only alongside a real marker.

// legacyMarkers: any one of these present under the DOOM dir means the original SnapHak is installed.
