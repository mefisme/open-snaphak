# Fidelity — the original's quirks, what the clone reproduces, and the one divergence

The clone was built to a **faithful-reproduction** bar: match the original SnapHak's observable
behavior first — including the ugly, mislabeled, and unfinished bits — and leave *fixing* what was
broken to a separate, later pass. That later pass happened, so several of
the original's quirks are now **fixed** in the shipped clone rather than reproduced. This document
records, per quirk, what the original did and what the **current** clone source actually does, so
the two never drift apart in a contributor's mind.

One behavior is a deliberate divergence from the start: the fault-shield (last section).

## Still faithful (reproduced on purpose)

### No Lua scripting
The original has an `Editor Lua` tab (internal name `lua_scripts_page`) that is an empty widget — no
children, no layout, no behavior; the Lua VM host behind it is dead code with no callers. The clone is
faithful in substance: it ships **no Lua runtime** either. It does not render the empty tab (dead chrome
isn't worth carrying); a real Lua editor is still future work.

### The manual 30 Hz think-loop
The frontend runs its own pump — drain the work-queue, apply deferred writes, pump the window's
messages, `Sleep(33 ms)` — rather than a framework event loop. This is faithful to the original *and*
load-bearing — heavy engine work is applied on this pump, and the pump plus the work-queue drain *are*
the frontend's main-thread execution point (see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md)). Reproduced
exactly, not modernized.

### Save-to-Decl does no *full* class/inherit compatibility check
The Entity-State "Save to Decl" commits the edited classname/inherit/displayname into the entity in
memory and does **no full compatibility check** — matching the original (whose own guide warns
"mismatch → crash"). The clone *does* add a narrow guard — a provably-fatal
class+inherit pair is **refused** ("Save refused: incompatible class+inherit combination") rather
than written, and any access violation that still slips through is caught by the fault-shield
(below). So the faithful "no full check" stance is preserved, but the catastrophic case is fenced off.

### Create-from-selection requires hovering a selected entity
The engine's own `populate()` (the `+0xb0` serialize-selection body) refuses to run unless the
editor is currently hovering an entity that's part of the selection — it prints its own message,
`"Failed to create prefab: not hovering entity in selection."`, and returns failure rather than
populating the temp prefab. This was initially mistaken for a clone bug (see
[`backend-changes.md`](backend-changes.md) for the actual crash root-causes it got tangled up with)
but is a genuine, faithfully-carried-over engine requirement, confirmed once those crashes were
fixed. The webview UI checks for it up front (the hovered-id slot, `+0x198`) and surfaces an
accurate "hover over an entity first" message instead of a crash or a misleading generic one.

## Fixed (the original was wrong; the clone is now right)

### `bsb` no longer pops `MessageBoxA("FUCK","fuckedy")`
The original's `bsb` (bulk-set-bool) handler had a leftover debug `MessageBoxA("FUCK","fuckedy")` on
its re-resolve-mismatch path — a development artifact that shipped. A re-resolve mismatch *is* a real
signal (a property/value that didn't round-trip), so the clone keeps the signal but surfaces it via a
**clean non-modal toast** ("bsb: some entities skipped …") instead of an intrusive debug box
(`src/backend/snapstack.c`). *(Some nearby code comments still describe the faithful reproduction of the original —
the behavior is the fixed one.)*

### `filtcls` reports the correct field
The original's `sh filtcls` (filter the stack by **classname**) reused the `filtinh` toast string and
mislabeled its output `"… had inherit %s"`. The clone **corrects the label** — `filtcls` reports
`"had class %s"` and `filtinh` reports `"had inherit %s"` — so the toast names the field actually
filtered (`src/backend/snapstack.c`).

## The one sanctioned divergence — the fault-shield

The original installs two fault detours (on the engine's `Error` and `FatalError`) that each format a
message, pop a `MessageBoxA`, and call `TerminateProcess` — destroying the engine's own recoverable
error path and killing DOOM.

The clone replaces those two kill-detours with a resident **fault-shield**: a vectored exception
handler (`src/fault_shield/`, **compiled into the backend `XINPUT1_3.dll`**) that catches the access
violation in DOOM's frame code, **reverts the bad edit, and shows a toast** instead of terminating the
process. This is the single deliberate behavioral departure from the original — it makes a class of
in-editor crashes recoverable rather than fatal — and it is what makes the "no full compat check"
stance above safe.
