/* shield_diag.h -- DIAGNOSTIC build hooks (compiled only when SH_DIAG is defined).
 *
 * A catch-all crash + environment logger for diagnosing a remote end-user's crash that the recovery
 * shield's VEH does NOT trap (a fault outside DOOM's code, or a __fastfail/heap-corruption). LOG-ONLY:
 * it never alters control flow, so it cannot change crash behavior -- safe to ship to an end-user.
 * Writes sh_diag.log under <DOOM>\snapmap-plus\logs\. See shield_diag.c.
