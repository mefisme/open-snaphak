/* entity.h -- the entity/spawn console commands (sh_dumpdef, sh_spawninfo,
 * sh_spawn), native C. Ports of OG XINPUT1_3 FUN_180021e60 (sh_dumpdef), FUN_180024d90 (sh_spawninfo),
 * FUN_180021c90 (sh_spawn).
 *
 * These three commands need engine state the rest of the command surface does not: the gameMgr (game/entity
 * manager) global, plus three vtable-slot virtual calls (cmdSystem +0x48 ExecuteCommandText, gameMgr
 * +0x498 FindEntity, idEntity +0x340 GetOrigin) and -- for sh_spawn -- SpawnByEntityDef@0x315AF0.
 *
 * Build portability (the reference-entity-layout trap):
 *   - gameMgr is decoded build-portably from the GameMgrLea accessor's RIP-relative MOV (reusing
 *     sh_commands' sh_decode_rip_slot), with a *(base+0x56ffb90) known-offset FALLBACK.
 *   - the vtable slot INDICES (+0x48/+0x498/+0x340) are decompile-verified but NOT in the source-of-
 *     record -- GetOrigin@+0x340 especially is OG-2021 evidence only, so sh_spawn GUARDS its teleport
 *     against a bogus vec3 (NaN or |coord|>1e6 -> skip the teleport, print a warning). Every engine
 *     deref is SEH-guarded; a wrong offset degrades to a clean no-op + log, never a crash/teleport-to-
 *     garbage.
 *   - the sh_dumpdef ent+0x6d0 -> +0x140 resolved-def-text chain is source-of-record-confirmed
 *     (the engine idlib schema) but build-sensitive -> SEH-guarded + non-null gated.
 *
 * Clean-room: ported from our own RE (the b2-t3-re foundation + the OG command decompiles). Zero OG bytes.
