/* rawmap.h -- the keystone rawmap LOAD swap, native C
 * (port of OG's DeserializeFromJson detour FUN_180023ad0).
 *
 * This is the core SnapHak feature, proven: SnapHak detours the engine's JSON-map deserializer
 * and SUBSTITUTES its own rawmap for the engine's input. With the swap armed, ANY engine map load is
 * transparently replaced by the contents of `%USERPROFILE%\snaphak\rawmap.json`.
 *
 * MECHANISM (DIRECT): OG's LOAD handler is a detour on
 *   idSnapMap::DeserializeFromJson(const char* json, idSnapMap* out)   [engine RVA 0x5ea490; variant A,
 *   buffer-first]
 * Its body, when the `snapHak_rawmaps_on` gate (OG DAT_18003e819) is set: build the rawmap.json path,
 *   fopen_s(...,"rb"), read the whole file into a fresh malloc'd buffer, OVERWRITE the engine's input
 *   JSON pointer (param_1) with it, log "SnapHak: Rawmap size %lld, read %lld.", then parse THAT buffer.
 * The clean-room reference implementation (item 1, doDeserializeSwap) does the identical thing with
 *   an external instrumentation tool: `onEnter: if (_gate && _rawmapBuf) { args[0] = _rawmapBuf; ... }`.
 *
 * NATIVE PORT (the difference from the instrumentation-hook form): an interceptor hook can mutate `args[0]` in place;
 * an inline detour CANNOT -- it REPLACES the function. So our detour has the SAME prototype as the
 * target and, when armed, calls the engine ORIGINAL (via the trampoline) with OUR buffer as arg0
 * instead of the engine's json. That is the exact semantic of "overwrite param_1" / "args[0] = buf",
 * and -- unlike OG's full re-implementation -- it reuses the engine's own real deserialize for the
 * parse, so there is nothing to keep in sync with the engine codec. We free OUR buffer after the call
 * (OG frees its substitute buffer too).
 *
 * Clean-room: ported from our own RE (the truth above) + the proven reference implementation. Zero OG SnapHak bytes.

 *
 * This is the SAVE half of SnapHak's rawmap feature: when the editor SAVES a SnapMap, SnapHak ALSO
 * writes the serialized map JSON to %USERPROFILE%\snaphak\rawmap.json, so the just-saved map becomes a
 * reusable rawmap (the inverse of the LOAD swap, which substitutes rawmap.json INTO a map load).
 *
 * MECHANISM (DIRECT, the OG decompile of
 * FUN_180023e60, ratified 2026-06-20): OG's SAVE handler is a detour on
 *   idSnapMap::SerializeToJson(idSnapMap* map, idStr* out, uint8 compact)   [engine RVA 0x5F2390]
 * OG's body RE-IMPLEMENTS the serialize (the engine original is never called): it reflection-serializes
 *   `map` to a parse-tree (engine 0x1a21b40 "idSnapMap"), renders the tree to JSON (engine 0x1a43730)
 *   into a local idStr, copies that JSON back into the engine's out-idStr `out` (so the NORMAL save still
 *   works), then builds the rawmap.json path (FUN_180023780, the same builder the LOAD source uses),
 *   fopen_s(...,"wb"), and fwrite(out.data, 1, out.len) -- reading len@out+0x8 / data@out+0x10 -- and
 *   logs "SnapHak: Wrote %lld bytes to rawmap.".
 *
 * NATIVE PORT (the SAME asymmetry the LOAD swap chose, vs OG's full re-implementation): an inline detour
 * REPLACES the target, but we want the engine's real serialize to run. So our detour has the SAME
 * prototype as SerializeToJson and, on every call, FIRST calls the engine ORIGINAL (via the
 * trampoline) to fill the engine's out-idStr `out` -- the normal save proceeds byte-for-byte untouched --
 * and THEN reads out.len/out.data and writes those bytes to rawmap.json. This reuses the engine's own
 * serializer (nothing to keep in sync with the engine codec) and is byte-identical in outcome to OG (the
 * engine serializer fills `out` either way). It is exactly what the proven reference implementation does
 * (the reference _saveHook: capture args[1] onEnter, read len@0x8/data@0x10 onLeave, write).
 *
 * Unlike the LOAD swap there is NO arm gate: OG writes the shadow on EVERY save (the only gate OG has on
 * the WHOLE rawmap feature is snapHak_rawmaps_on, which gates LOAD substitution; the save-shadow handler
 * has no flag check -- it always writes when the map serializes). The shadow is failure-tolerant: any
 * file op that fails simply skips the shadow write; the real save (the engine original's fill of `out`)
 * has already happened, so a shadow failure NEVER blocks or corrupts the real save.
 *
 * Clean-room: ported from our own RE (the truth above + the OG decompile) + the proven reference
 * reimplementation. Zero OG SnapHak bytes.
