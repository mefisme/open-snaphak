/* patch.h -- the Snapmap+ backend's reusable engine-code PATCH/DETOUR layer.
 *
 * This is the SAFETY layer the upcoming engine-code-patch consumers ride on:
 *   [15][16] devmode  -- patch a hand-assembled code region at engine RVA 0x18a31d0 (memcpy-to-RX).
 *   [11] render-logging + [18] cs_dontuse -- install jmp-detours over engine code.
 * (Both clusters are later work; this builds + self-tests the LAYER only -- NO engine patches.)
 *
 * It mirrors OG SnapHak's two self-modifying-code primitives (OG base 0x180000000):
 *   FUN_180001790(dst,len,src)  = memcpy-to-RX   (VirtualProtect RWX -> copy -> restore)   == code_patch
 *   FUN_180001850(hookFn,rva)   = inline-detour installer  (jmp at engineBase+rva -> hook) == install_detour
 *   FUN_180001920(tramp)        = uninstall                                                == uninstall_detour
 * The detour family is ALREADY cloned in hook.c (install_inline_hook / hook_unpatch); this layer REUSES
 * it (sh_install_detour is a thin pass-through, NOT a reimplementation) and adds code_patch/code_unpatch.
 *
 * THE WHOLE POINT IS SAFETY -- a stale/shifted target = engine corruption. So:
 *  - The caller resolves the patch TARGET by SIGNATURE (signatures.h resolver), NOT a raw RVA. A unique
 *    sig match BY CONSTRUCTION verifies the expected original bytes are present at the site. The two
 *    sig-anchored entry points (code_patch_sig / install_detour_sig) take a resolved sig_result and
 *    REFUSE (no write) unless the resolve was a clean unique hit (SIG_OK). This is the verify-before-write.
 *  - code_patch additionally re-checks `expect` (the bytes the caller asserts are currently there) against
 *    the live target before writing -- a second, byte-exact verify. Mismatch => REFUSE, no write, logged.
 *  - Every op records the original bytes (a restore-handle) so the patch is reversible.
 *  - Every memory touch is SEH-guarded; any fault logs + returns a clean error, never a partial write.
 *
 * Clean-room: ported from our own RE (the evidence above + hook.c). Zero OG SnapHak bytes.
