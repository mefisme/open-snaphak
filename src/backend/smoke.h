/* smoke.h -- the foundation smoke proof for the Snapmap+ backend.
 *
 * Proves the two foundation pieces work end-to-end against the LIVE DOOM module, with a visible
 * signal an attached debugger captures (OutputDebugStringA via backend_log):
 *   1. the signature resolver re-finds the engine fns by SIGNATURE (no hardcoded RVA), and
 *   2. the inline-detour installer patches + invokes + reverses a detour.
 *
 * Emits one line:  "PB0: resolved N/M sigs (deferred Tms past load) ...; test detour OK"  (or a
 * specific failure form, e.g. the SteamStub-not-decrypted timeout).
 *
 * DEFERRAL: DOOMx64vk.exe is SteamStub-wrapped -- its `.text` is encrypted at DLL-init and only
 * decrypted later, so the bootstrap thread POLLS sh_resolve_count until the whole DB resolves (the
 * decrypt has landed) before calling sh_smoke_run. See dllmain.c + steamstub-drm-unpack.md.
