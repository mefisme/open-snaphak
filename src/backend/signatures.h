/* signatures.h -- version-portable masked-byte engine-function resolver for the SnapHak BACKEND
 * (our clean-room XINPUT1_3.dll). C port of the reference implementation's signature table.
 *
 * SnapHak hardcodes `engineBase + rva` (build-locked to its 2021 DOOM). We instead carry a masked
 * byte SIGNATURE per engine function and scan the live DOOM module's executable bytes for it, so the
 * backend ports to an RVA-shifted DOOM with no Ghidra and no hardcoded RVAs (the build-mismatch
 * lesson, memory `reference-entity-layout-offsets-build-specific`). A signature pins exactly one
 * location or it is rejected -- a resolve that is not UNIQUE is a failure, never a guess.
 *
 * This runs against the ALREADY-MAPPED DOOM module in our own address space (GetModuleHandle gives the
 * runtime base; the PE headers + section table are present in-memory), not a file on disk -- so the
 * matcher reads each section's mapped virtual bytes directly, no RVA<->file-offset translation.
 *
 * (Self-contained: no dependency on the fault-shield DLL. The fault-shield is a SEPARATE proxy with a
 *  DIFFERENT signature; this resolver lives in and ships with the backend only.)
